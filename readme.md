## About

A responsive web page consists of a header (brand, menu button, navigation), main section (about us, pricing and booking) and footer (contact information). The navigation menu collapses on devices with a screen width of less than 768 pixels and automatically expands after resizing if the screen is large enough. The booking form consists of 2 input fields (name and phone number) and 3 radio buttons corresponding to the existing types of coworking. After the form is submitted, a successful submission message should appear on the screen.

## Set Up

To start project locally on your machine do the folowing steps:

1. Clone repository

   Attention! Repository will be cloned and saved as the folder with appropriate name in your current working directory. E.g if you are cloning from 'Visual Studio Code/' all project files will be clones into 'Visual Studio Code/epam-coworking/'.

   `git clone https://github.com/midjiro/epam-coworking.git`

2. Switch to dev branch

   Since master branch is used to store use-ready project version, it is undesirable to push all changes in it.

   If you are a team member, please switch to the dev branch using the command

   `git checkout dev`

   or

   `git checkout -b dev`

   in case if such branch does not exists.
   To make sure everything is okay execute

   `git branch`

3. Now you are ready to go!
