## About

A responsive web page consists of a header (brand, menu button, navigation), main section (about us, pricing and booking) and footer (contact information). The navigation menu collapses on devices with a screen width of less than 768 pixels and automatically expands after resizing if the screen is large enough. The booking form consists of 2 input fields (name and phone number) and 3 radio buttons corresponding to the existing types of coworking. After the form is submitted, a successful submission message should appear on the screen.
